S3 Access Manager - System Objective & Flow
System Objective
The primary objective is to create a secure, role-based S3 access management system that provides controlled access to cloud storage resources through distinct user interfaces. The system will authenticate users through AWS Cognito and automatically route them to appropriate dashboards based on their assigned groups - regular users to a limited-access user dashboard and administrators to a full-control admin dashboard. Users will be able to view all available S3 buckets but only access those for which they have explicit permissions, while administrators maintain unrestricted access to all storage resources. The system addresses the critical need for granular access control in enterprise environments where different users require varying levels of access to sensitive data stored in cloud buckets, ensuring security compliance while maintaining operational efficiency.
System Flow
Upon login, users authenticate through AWS Cognito, which validates their credentials and determines their group membership to redirect them to the appropriate dashboard interface. Regular users can browse and view all S3 buckets in the system but can only download or interact with content from buckets where they have been granted specific permissions, creating a controlled browsing experience. When users need access to restricted buckets, they can submit temporary access requests through their dashboard, providing justification for the additional permissions they require. These requests are immediately visible to administrators in their dashboard, who can review the justification, approve or decline the request, and set time-limited access periods for approved requests. Throughout this process, all authentication, authorization, and permission management is handled entirely within the AWS ecosystem, ensuring that access decisions are enforced at the cloud infrastructure level rather than relying on application-level security, while maintaining detailed audit trails of all access requests and approvals for compliance and security monitoring purposes.
